Everything in base game works. There is an implemented pauseTimer in base game seperate from the timerClicks, to help with pausing.
checkLastKeyPressed updates too quickly in the GameGrid class, so this additional timer was made to slow down and allow the 
Scanner to collect information, instead of freezing and failing to collect data over and over.
Probability of items spawned was changed from boolean to integer to increase control over item spawning. Image changing has been
implemented. Screenshots are saved to screenshot.png, with a planned screenshot+(n).png to better organize screenshots. 
Several known bugs with scrollLeft have been squashed, mainly regarding array boundries and how the array updates left to right,
up to down. This includes error with persistant objects blocked by the User object, multiple User object created by blocked objects,
and tendencies to have objects repeat themselves infinitely until they are updated. For the border, text has been added into the 
console to convey messages to the user. This feature will most likely be extended in the main game to multiple classes, as adding
text to the main game other than the title screen or outcome screen is difficult to implement without knowledge of JFrame (not that
I'm implying that I know how to use it)
